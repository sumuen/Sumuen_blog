我高中时候的同桌非常喜欢‘苏’这个姓氏，我个人喜欢叫自己‘沐’，加上大一常看一个bilibili up主‘托马斯家的’，他情侣的名字就叫穆恩，我就把这两个名字合起来叫自己‘苏沐恩',一直用到现在，我很喜欢这个名字，就是英文名一直没想好，算了。

目标是全栈工程师，爱好运维，你可以在[GitHub](https://github.com/sumuen)关注我,当然我很菜啦，但是我会一直一直学习的。

In high school, my desk-mate was very fond of the surname 'Su'. Personally, I like to call myself 'Mu'. Plus, during my freshman year in college, I often watched a Bilibili content creator named 'Thomas's House', and his partner's name was 'Muen'. So, I combined these two names and called myself 'Su Muen', and I've been using it ever since. I really like this name, but I haven't figured out an English name for myself yet. Oh well.

My goal is to be a full-stack engineer and I have a passion for operations. You can follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/sumuen). Of course, I'm still a novice, but I will always continue to learn.
